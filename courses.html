          Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) is an academic program that integrates the fields of computer engineering and computer science,providing knowledge of computing systems in both hardware and software design.The study program is modeled on German technical universities, where CS, CE and IT are treated as respectively the theoretical, technical and practical part of one field called "Informatik".
        </p>
        <p>
Although Computer Science and Engineering is the common designation for the combined program, some universities (such as Berkeley and MIT) call their program Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).[3] Furthermore, there are some universities (such as UCI and UC Merced) that named their department EECS and the program housed within CSE. In Germany and many European countries, similar programs are taught by technical universities and are called "Technische Informatik" or generally "Informatik".        </p>

<p>
Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study,design and application of equipment,devices and systems which use electricity,electronics and electromagnetism.It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution and use.
</p>
<p>
Electrical engineering is now divided into a wide range of fields, including computer engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, and electronics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics, and electrical materials science. See glossary of electrical and electronics engineering.</p>

<p>
Mechanical engineering is an engineering discipline that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science to design,analyze,manufacture and maintain mechanical systems.It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering disciplines.
</p>
<p>The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.
